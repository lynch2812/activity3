# NumPy (Numerical Python) is a powerful library in Python that provides support for large, 
# multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a wide collection of 
# mathematical functions to operate on these arrays efficiently. 
# It is widely used in scientific computing, data analysis, 
# machine learning, and other fields requiring numerical computations.

# using [1:4] for example would slice and output numbers 1 - 3
#import numpy as np

#myarray = np.array([1,2,3,4,5])
