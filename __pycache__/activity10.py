#Project Frequency Counter 
#Create a Python script that counts the frequency of words in a given text using dictionaries, 
# conditional sentences, loops, and recursive functions.
#nstructions:

#1. Create a function that takes a string of text as input.

#2. Use a dictionary to store the frequency of each word in the text.

#3. Use conditional sentences to handle special cases (e.g., empty input).

#4. Use loops to iterate over the words in the text.

#5. Use a recursive function to process the text and update the word frequency dictionary.
