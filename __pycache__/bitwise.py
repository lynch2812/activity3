#& The & operator performs a bitwise and operation on coresponding bits of two  integars, ot returns a new integar with bits set to 1  if both inputs are 1 

a = 2
b = 9 
result=a&b

print(result)
 
 # OR
 # | = or turns binary back in to decimal 
a = 5 
b = 3
result = a|b
print(result)

# << left shift , shifts the bits of an integar left by the number of positions and multiplys the integar
a = 10
result = a<<2
print(result)

# >> right shift divides the integar by the number requested 

a = 20
result = a>>4
print(result)
