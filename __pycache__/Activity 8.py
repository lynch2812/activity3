#Create a list of test scores for a student.
#Use floor division to calculate the average score.
#Use comparison operators to determine the grade based on the average score.
#Use assignment operators to update the student's grade.
#Use membership operators to check if a specific score exists in the list of scores.
#Use identity operators to compare objects.
#Use bitwise operators to perform bitwise operations on the scores.
